# Smart Grid Optimization Using Genetic Algorithm and Parallel Computing

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing energy distribution in a smart grid using Genetic Algorithms (GA) with parallel computing. It simulates a smart grid with dynamic power demands, multiple renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro), and transmission constraints.

##  Objectives
- Minimize energy cost
- Minimize transmission loss
- Maximize demand fulfillment

## ⚙ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Multiprocessing
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)

##  Genetic Algorithm Features
- Chromosome = energy allocation for 24 hours
- Fitness function with penalties
- Parallelized fitness evaluation using `multiprocessing`

##  Dataset
- Simulated dataset with:
  - 10 Nodes (Consumers)
  - 3 Sources (Solar, Wind, Hydro)
  - 24-hour cycle demand profile

##  Results
- Compared Parallel GA vs. Serial GA
- Showed better runtime and convergence
- GA outperformed Greedy baseline in cost efficiency
